# CSharp-Collections-Project

## 📌 Project Description
CSharp-Collections-Project is a **console-based shopping cart application** built in C#. The project demonstrates the practical use of **collections** such as **List, Dictionary, Stack, Tuple, and IEnumerable** by implementing a fully functional shopping cart system.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **C#**
- **.NET Console Application**
- **Collections (List, Dictionary, Stack, Tuple, IEnumerable)**

## 📝 Code Highlights
- **List<string> CartItems** → Stores the items added to the cart.
- **Dictionary<string, double> ItemPrices** → Stores available items with their prices.
